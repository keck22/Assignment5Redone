# Executive Summary
This week we have learned how to make an EER Model from the guitar database, normalize data, and create new views for the EER model
# Normalization/EER Model
I wanted to be able to turn in as much as I could and still do not truly understand Normalization. The EER Model on the other hand was pretty straight forward. I followed your creating an EER diagram video and did very little research on my own to figure this model out. 
# Conclusion
This weeks objective was to make an EER model, normalize the data of the students, add to the table, and create different views of the EER model.
